Objectives:
1. Write a method that implements Selection Sort.
2. Write a method that implements Quick Sort with the pivot in the first position of the subarray.
3. Write a method that implements Quick Sort and choose three positions of the subaray at random and make the median of the values the pivot. 
4. Calculate the run time for each when the input for each array is in increasing, decreasing, and random order.
5. Use random numbers in a text file and sort them using the methods created above.

Data in nanoseconds:
NOTE: Eclipse rouded the numbers.

Selection Sort:
*   Increasing: 85900 nanosecs
*   Decreasing: 67800 nanosecs
*   Random: 68700 nanosecs
*   COVIDcases.txt: 94000 nanosecs

Quick Sort (first position pivot):
*   Increasing: 262600 nanosecs
*   Decreasing: 196100 nanosecs
*   Random: 47500 nanosecs
*   COVIDcases.txt: 18000 nanosecs

Quick Sort (median of three random positions pivot):
*   Increasing: 158200 nanosecs
*   Decreasing: 107000 nanosecs
*   Random: 31600 nanosecs
*   COVIDcases.txt: 20300 nanosecs
